Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

## Be Respectful

- Respect other players, their time, and their creations.
- Harassment, excessive toxicity, or intentionally ruining others’ fun is not acceptable.

## No Irreversible Damage

- Pranks are allowed as long as they are reversible.
- Do not permanently destroy builds, farms, redstone, or terrain.
- If you cause damage accidentally, **FIX IT**!

## Respect Ownership

- Do not take items from chests, farms, or storage you do not own.
- Do not modify other players’ builds without permission.
- Public resources must be clearly marked as public.

## Don't Cheat

- No hacked clients, x-ray.
- Quality-of-life mods are allowed unless stated otherwise.

## Communicate First

- If there is a disagreement or problem, **talk it out first**.

## Gentlemen’s Agreements (Guidelines)
These are not strict rules, but strongly encouraged:
- Do not kill other players’ pets.
- Ask before building very close to someone else.
- Help new players when possible.
- Clean up creeper holes you cause.
